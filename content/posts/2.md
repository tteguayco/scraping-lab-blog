It is always a good idea to draw some mockups before jumping right into code!

The following images depict the very basic idea of how the UI will initially look like, which means there can be (more than one) changes eventually during development phase.

This sequence of mockups capture how the typical workflow in the app for a user will be: configure the requests, write and test the selectors to extract data and finally check and save the autogenerated source code for the scraper. Notice also the user will be able to create and have more than one scraper in the app's environment.

* **Request tab**:

    ![request](/img/request.png)

<br />

* **Selectors tab**:

    ![selectors](/img/selectors.png)

<br />

* **Source code tab**:

    ![source_code](/img/source_code.png)

<br />

This will be the first stage of the development: the **frontend** part. For that we will use Angular 11 + Electron :smile:

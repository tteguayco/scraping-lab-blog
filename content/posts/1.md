## Introduction

The idea behind Scraping Lab is quite simple: it is desktop app with a powerful user interface made with Electron aimed to serve as an aide tool for developers, in order to help them build their web scrapers faster for the [Scrapy](https://scrapy.org/) framework (also known as spiders). From the Scraping Lab UI, at the same time the user tests their assumptions regarding requests and selectors to extract data, the code for their spider will be generating behind the scenes (just copy and paste when you are done!).

I came up with this idea after observing a widespread lack of this kind of tools out there. There is for example [scrapy-GUI](https://github.com/further-reading/scrapy-gui) but it consists of a very simple UI and the user still needs to build their own spider code from scratch. Furthermore, I plan not to restrict the tool to just Scrapy, but also add support for other scraping frameworks like [Apify SDK](https://github.com/apify/apify-js).

## Tech Stack

* [Electron](https://github.com/electron/electron): to build an awesome UI!
* [Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs): the heart of Electron.
* [Angular 11](https://angular.io/): one of the most used (and cool) front-end frameworks these days.
* [Python](https://www.python.org/): backend-logic to access Scrapy methods.

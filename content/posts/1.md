## Introduction

The idea behind Scraping Lab is quite simple: a desktop app with a powerful user interface made with Electron aimed to serve as an aide tool for developers, in order to help them build their web scrapers faster for the [Scrapy](https://scrapy.org/) framework (also known as _spiders_). From the Scraping Lab UI, at the same time the user tests their assumptions regarding requests and selectors to extract data, the code for their spider will be generating behind the scenes (just copy and paste when you are done!).

I came up with this idea after observing a widespread lack of this kind of tools out there. There is for example [scrapy-GUI](https://github.com/further-reading/scrapy-gui) but it consists of a very simple UI and the user still needs to build their own spider code from scratch. Furthermore, I plan not to restrict the tool to just Scrapy, but also add support for other scraping frameworks like [Apify SDK](https://github.com/apify/apify-js).

## Features

Some of the features the tool will initially have are:
* Make requests via HTTP GET, HTTP POST and also via [Splash](https://github.com/scrapinghub/splash).
* Configure settings for requests such as headers, payload and cookies.
* Editor for writing and testing selectors using CSS, XPATH and Regex.
* Autogeneration of Scrapy spider code.

## Tech Stack

The following are the technologies I will use for the development of this project:
* [Electron](https://github.com/electron/electron): to build an awesome UI!
* [Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs): the heart of Electron.
* [Angular 11](https://angular.io/): one of the most used (and coolest) front-end frameworks these days.
* [Python](https://www.python.org/): backend-logic to access Scrapy methods.

## Open Source Commitment

Scraping Lab will entirely be developed using open source dependencies and the source code will be released on GitHub under a [GPL-3.0 License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html).
